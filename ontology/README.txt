As of 26 May 2015, the SHRINE ontology is being relocated to its own separate repository at https://open.med.harvard.edu/svn/shrine-ontology.  As a convenience, history will continue to be available here, but all future ontology development should happen in the new repository.

For details, see https://open.med.harvard.edu/jira/browse/ITEAM-235

This directory will be set to read-only.
