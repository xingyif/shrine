### Getting Up and Running From Scratch

From command line run: __npm run build-start__

This will install all dependencies and boot up a mocked local instance of the app.


### Booting up local dev environment
From command line run:  __npm start__
this will start up the server and open the app in the browser.

### Todo: the grunt:watch, minification e.t.c. 
task needs to be fixed so that src/**/*.js is watched and compiled on change, 
currently for any change to be reflected the command: __grunt__ must entered at the command line.  These 
build tools really need updating as they are about 4 years old.
